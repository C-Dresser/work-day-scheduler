# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This is a work day scheduler. It allows the user to input tasks to complete at certain times of the day, and save said tasks to local storage. The user can update and resave the tasks at any time. The program will also display the current date and will change the color of each time block depending on if that time has already passed, is in the future, or is the current hour of the day, all using DayJs.
